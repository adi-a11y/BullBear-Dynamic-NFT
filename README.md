Used Chainlink oracle data feeds and Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) to create this BullBear NFT.

Whenever the price of BTC/USD varies and the upkeep is performed, the NFT changes!

Initially, a default NFT gets minted and price of BTC/USD are noted. Whenever the upkeep is performed,
if the market is Bullish comapred to the last noted time, NFT changes to a random Bull NFT and
if the market is Bearish comapred to the last noted time, NFT changes to a random Bear NFT.


Corrections and suggestions are most welcome!

Thank you and have a good day!
